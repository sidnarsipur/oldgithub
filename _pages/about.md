Hi, I'm Siddharth. I'm a sophomore at the University of Rochester studying Computer Science, while occasionally dabbling in Political Science and Media Studies.

Summer 2023: I interned for the software team at [LiquiDonate](https://liquidonate.com/), working on extending their marketplace to APIs and building cool internal tools.

Upcoming Summer: I'll be working under Professor [Yukang Yan](https://rochester-bear-lab.github.io/), conducting research on automated Mixed Reality (MR) interfaces.

My main interests are in Computer Vision, Computer Systems and Mixed Reality.

You can find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q66KxhUetqdje1e44js0sfIEkZxQoDgO/view?usp=sharing).
